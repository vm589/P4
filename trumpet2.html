        Brass instruments have been around for as long as ancient history has started to be recorded.
        The earliest version of not just brass instruments, but all instruments, is the Trumpet. The trumpet
        is the earliest variation of any brass instrument said to be found in 1500 B.C. At first it was made out of
        wood, bronze, and copper. Initially, it was not even an instrument. Because of how loud it was, it was used
        as a signalling device for military purposes or to grab attention. As even though it was used as an instrument
        it could only play a handful of notes. However, as the medeival ages came around that would change, inventors
        and craftsman would help re invent it to play more notes. By making the metal turn almost like a tube,
        the instrument was now longer and could be used to play more notes. This version was called the Baroque Trumpet
        and used by many famous composers. However it still did not have any valves and  
        that would only change around the 19th century, when trumpet player Weidinger would make this new trumpet,
        which is the modern version we know today.
